          <p class="card-content">At Simple Truth Church, we believe and teach the Gospel. That God created men and women in His image to live in relationship with Him. Yet all people have rebelled against God and rejected that relationship. But God, in His mercy, sent His Son, Jesus Christ to die on the cross to bear the consequences of our sins and to restore us to a right relationship with God. We desire that unbelieving men and women would hear and believe this message, fall in love with Jesus, and stay in love with Jesus.</p>

          <h2 class="card-hero">Establishing Faith And Growth</h2>
          <p class="card-content">The Bible teaches that Christian life is one of ongoing growth as we become more like Jesus. It is our desire that the preaching at Simple Truth Church would assist believers in their understanding of Scripture and the responsibilities of Christian living.</p>

          <h2 class="card-hero">Reaching Our Communities</h2>
          <p class="card-content">At Simple Truth Church, we believe that following Jesus changes the core being of who we are. And from that transformation our deeds – what we do and how we do what we do – change remarkably. We want to live out our right relationship with God as examples in loving our own community, causing others to be zealous for the Gospel and wanting to become followers of Jesus.</p>
