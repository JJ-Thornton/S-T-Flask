        <p class="donation-content">Giving is an act of worship. Unlike the traditional practice of tithing in the Old Testament, where it was mandatory to give under Mosaic Law. Through Jesus' fulfillment of the Old Testament, we are free to give from our hearts, without fear. Giving is voluntary free-willed worship based on Gods goodness and trustworthiness (2 Corinthians 9:6-8). Jesus is the greatest treasure, as Christians we claim this and believe He will provide what we need(Luke 12:13-34)</p>

        <p class="content-pt2">At Simple Truth, we do not pass a collection plate around the congregation. The Agape Box by the door serves a second purpose of collecting donations, this is because tithes are not our concern, Jesus is, as a church our job is to share the love that Christ has shown us in our personal lives to you, that is our concern. By collecting in this fashion it allows for the focus to be on Jesus and not on what your neighbor has given, eliminating any pressure to give from visiting peoples or those of us who need every cent in this season of life.</p>
